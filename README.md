as this is my current experimental/learning/development project, there probably are many useless/unused dependencies and stuff

### how to
1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ webpack`
3. `$ hz serve --dev`
4. go to: http://127.0.0.1:8181/

### thanks
* RethinkDB team (rethinkdb & horizon)
* Google (angular & ... google :D)
* AngularClass (webpack and angular stuff are based on: [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter))
* all I forgot to mention
